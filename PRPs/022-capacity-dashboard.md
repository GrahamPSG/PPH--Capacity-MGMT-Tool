### Database Extensions
```prisma
model CapacitySnapshot {
  id                String   @id @default(uuid())
  date              DateTime
  division          Division
  totalCapacity     Int      // Total available hours
  allocatedCapacity Int      // Hours allocated to projects
  utilization       Decimal  @db.Decimal(5, 2) // Percentage
  employeeCount     Int
  projectCount      Int
  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())

  @@unique([date, division])
  @@index([date])
  @@index([division])
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Capacity Calculation Service**
   - Calculate total capacity (employees Ã— 40 hours/week)
   - Calculate allocated capacity (sum of crew assignments)
   - Calculate utilization percentage
   - Calculate available capacity
   - Group by division, employee, project
   - Calculate overtime allocation

2. **Implement Capacity Heatmap**
   - Grid layout: rows = divisions/employees, columns = weeks
   - Color coding: green (underutilized) â†’ yellow (optimal) â†’ red (overallocated)
   - Thresholds: <70% green, 70-90% yellow, 90-110% orange, >110% red
   - Hover tooltip showing exact percentage
   - Click to drill down into detail
   - Support week, month, quarter views

3. **Build Utilization Charts**
   - Stacked bar chart by division
   - Line chart showing utilization trend over time
   - Combo chart: capacity (bars) + utilization % (line)
   - Show target utilization line (e.g., 85%)
   - Highlight over/under capacity
   - Support date range selection

4. **Create Division Breakdown**
   - Card for each division showing:
     - Total capacity
     - Allocated capacity
     - Utilization percentage
     - Employee count
     - Active project count
   - Visual gauge for utilization
   - Color-coded status indicator
   - Click to view division details

5. **Implement Employee Capacity Cards**
   - List all employees with capacity info
   - Show allocation across projects
   - Mini chart showing weekly allocation
   - Flag overallocated employees (>40 hrs/week)
   - Show available capacity
   - Support sorting and filtering

6. **Add Capacity Forecasting**
   - Project capacity needs for next 3/6/12 months
   - Based on awarded and quoted projects
   - Show confidence intervals
   - Alert on projected overallocation
   - Hiring recommendations
   - Scenario planning

7. **Create Real-Time Updates**
   - WebSocket integration for live updates
   - Refresh when crew assignments change
   - Animate capacity changes
   - Show "Updated X seconds ago" indicator
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

8. **Add Dashboard Filters**
   - Filter by division
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by employee role
   - Filter by project status
   - Filter by capacity threshold
   - Save filter presets

9. **Implement Key Metrics**
   - Overall utilization percentage
   - Total available capacity
   - Capacity gap (needed - available)
   - Top 5 most utilized employees
   - Divisions at risk
   - Projected capacity in 30/60/90 days

âœ“ Utilization charts (bar, line, combo)
âœ“ Division breakdown with key metrics
âœ“ Employee capacity cards with allocation details
âœ“ Capacity forecasting for 3/6/12 months
âœ“ Real-time updates via WebSocket
âœ“ Filtering and sorting controls
âœ“ Performance optimized (<2 second load)
âœ“ All tests passing (>80% coverage)
```

## Key Calculations

### Utilization Percentage
```typescript
totalCapacity = employeeCount * 40 hours/week
allocatedCapacity = sum(crewAssignments.hoursPerWeek)
utilization = (allocatedCapacity / totalCapacity) * 100
```

### Capacity Gap
```typescript
capacityGap = requiredCapacity - availableCapacity
// Positive gap = need more capacity (hiring)
// Negative gap = excess capacity (opportunity)
```

### Forecast Calculation
```typescript
// Based on awarded + quoted projects (weighted by probability)
forecastedDemand = sum(awardedProjects.laborHours) +
                   sum(quotedProjects.laborHours * winProbability)
```

### Color Thresholds
```typescript
const COLOR_THRESHOLDS = {
  underutilized: { max: 70, color: '#10B981' },   // Green
  optimal: { min: 70, max: 90, color: '#F59E0B' }, // Yellow
  high: { min: 90, max: 110, color: '#F97316' },   // Orange
  overallocated: { min: 110, color: '#EF4444' }    // Red
}
```

## Related PRPs
- Depends on: PRP-005 (Capacity Management), PRP-024 (WebSocket Real-time)
- Related: PRP-021 (Gantt Chart), PRP-027 (Reporting Engine)
- Blocks: None (can be implemented independently)

## Estimated Time
10-12 hours

## Notes
- Target utilization is typically 80-85% (allows for flexibility)
- 100% utilization is actually concerning (no buffer for changes)
- Consider vacation, holidays, training in capacity calculations
- Overtime should be tracked separately (flag if >5% of total)
- Include bench time (employees not on projects) in metrics
- Consider skill matching (not just hours available)
- Factor in ramp-up time for new employees (50% capacity first month)
- Show both billable and non-billable capacity
- Consider implementing capacity planning AI (ML-based forecasting)
- Cache heatmap calculations (15-minute TTL)
- Use Redis for real-time capacity updates
- Support CSV export of capacity data
- Add notifications when division exceeds capacity

## Rollback Plan
If validation fails:
1. Verify database migration for CapacitySnapshot model
2. Check capacity calculation formulas
3. Test with small dataset first (10 employees)
4. Verify heatmap rendering with sample data
5. Check chart library integration (Chart.js or Recharts)
6. Test WebSocket connection for real-time updates
7. Review filter logic independently
8. Check API endpoint responses
9. Test performance with Chrome DevTools
10. Verify color threshold calculations
