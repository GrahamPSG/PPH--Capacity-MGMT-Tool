### Database Schema Updates
```typescript
// From spec.md - CapacitySnapshot model
model CapacitySnapshot {
  id                    String   @id @default(uuid())
  date                  DateTime
  division              Division
  totalEmployees        Int
  availableHours        Float
  scheduledHours        Float
  utilizationPercentage Float
  foremanCount          Int
  journeymanCount       Int
  apprenticeCount       Int
  projectCount          Int
  criticalProjects      String[] // Project IDs
  generatedAt           DateTime @default(now())

  @@unique([date, division])
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Database Migration**
   - Add CapacitySnapshot model to Prisma schema
   - Generate and run migration
   - Add indexes on date, division, generatedAt
   - Set up automatic snapshot generation (daily)

2. **Build Capacity Calculator**
   - Calculate total employee hours by division
   - Factor in employee maxHoursPerWeek
   - Factor in employee availability dates
   - Calculate scheduled hours from crew assignments
   - Calculate available hours (total - scheduled)
   - Calculate utilization percentage
   - Break down by employee type (foreman, journeyman, apprentice)

3. **Implement Utilization Calculator**
   - Calculate utilization percentage per division
   - Calculate utilization by employee type
   - Calculate utilization by date range (week, month)
   - Identify over-utilized divisions (>100%)
   - Identify under-utilized divisions (<70%)
   - Generate utilization trends over time

4. **Create Snapshot Generator**
   - Generate daily capacity snapshots
   - Capture division-level metrics
   - Identify critical projects (high priority, low capacity)
   - Store snapshot in database
   - Archive old snapshots (>6 months)
   - Run nightly via cron job

5. **Build Division Analyzer**
   - Analyze capacity by division
   - Compare divisions (utilization, headcount)
   - Identify bottleneck divisions
   - Recommend resource allocation
   - Generate division reports
   - Track division trends over time

6. **Implement Critical Project Detector**
   - Detect projects with insufficient crew assignments
   - Detect projects exceeding capacity
   - Detect projects with missing foreman
   - Detect projects delayed due to capacity
   - Prioritize critical projects
   - Generate actionable recommendations

7. **Build API Routes**
   - GET /api/capacity/current - Current capacity all divisions
   - GET /api/capacity/current?division=X - Division-specific
   - POST /api/capacity/snapshot - Generate snapshot on-demand
   - GET /api/capacity/utilization?startDate=X&endDate=Y - Utilization report
   - GET /api/capacity/division/:division - Division analysis
   - GET /api/capacity/history?division=X&days=90 - Historical data
   - GET /api/capacity/critical-projects - Projects needing attention

8. **Build React Components**
   - CapacityDashboard with key metrics
   - UtilizationChart with Recharts
   - DivisionBreakdown with comparison
   - CapacityGauge with color coding
   - CriticalProjects with alerts
   - HistoricalTrends with line charts
   - Export capacity reports to PDF/Excel

## Capacity Calculation Formulas

```typescript
class CapacityCalculator {
  // Calculate total available hours for a division on a date
  calculateAvailableHours(division: Division, date: Date): number {
    const employees = this.getActiveEmployees(division, date);

    let totalHours = 0;
    for (const employee of employees) {
      // Check if employee available on this date
      if (this.isAvailable(employee, date)) {
        // Use maxHoursPerWeek, default 40
        const dailyHours = (employee.maxHoursPerWeek || 40) / 5; // Assuming 5-day week
        totalHours += dailyHours;
      }
    }

    return totalHours;
  }

  // Calculate scheduled hours for a division on a date
  calculateScheduledHours(division: Division, date: Date): number {
    const assignments = this.getAssignmentsByDivisionAndDate(division, date);

    return assignments.reduce((sum, assignment) => {
      return sum + assignment.hoursAllocated;
    }, 0);
  }

  // Calculate utilization percentage
  calculateUtilization(division: Division, date: Date): number {
    const available = this.calculateAvailableHours(division, date);
    const scheduled = this.calculateScheduledHours(division, date);

    if (available === 0) return 0;

    return (scheduled / available) * 100;
  }

  // Calculate weekly capacity
  calculateWeeklyCapacity(division: Division, weekStart: Date): CapacityReport {
    const weekDays = this.getWeekDays(weekStart);

    let totalAvailable = 0;
    let totalScheduled = 0;

    for (const day of weekDays) {
      totalAvailable += this.calculateAvailableHours(division, day);
      totalScheduled += this.calculateScheduledHours(division, day);
    }

    return {
      availableHours: totalAvailable,
      scheduledHours: totalScheduled,
      utilizationPercentage: (totalScheduled / totalAvailable) * 100
    };
  }
}
```

## Critical Project Detection

```typescript
interface CriticalProject {
  projectId: string;
  reason: CriticalReason;
  severity: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH' | 'CRITICAL';
  recommendation: string;
}

enum CriticalReason {
  INSUFFICIENT_CREW = 'Crew size below requirements',
  MISSING_FOREMAN = 'No foreman assigned',
  OVER_CAPACITY = 'Division capacity exceeded',
  DELAYED = 'Project behind schedule',
  UNDER_STAFFED = 'Not enough employees assigned'
}

class CriticalProjectDetector {
  detectCriticalProjects(division: Division, date: Date): CriticalProject[] {
    const projects = this.getActiveProjects(division);
    const critical: CriticalProject[] = [];

    for (const project of projects) {
      // Check for missing foreman
      if (!this.hasForeman(project, date)) {
        critical.push({
          projectId: project.id,
          reason: CriticalReason.MISSING_FOREMAN,
          severity: 'HIGH',
          recommendation: 'Assign available foreman immediately'
        });
      }

      // Check for insufficient crew
      const phase = this.getCurrentPhase(project, date);
      if (phase) {
        const assignedCrew = this.getCrewSize(phase, date);
        if (assignedCrew < phase.requiredCrewSize) {
          critical.push({
            projectId: project.id,
            reason: CriticalReason.INSUFFICIENT_CREW,
            severity: 'MEDIUM',
            recommendation: `Assign ${phase.requiredCrewSize - assignedCrew} more employees`
          });
        }
      }
    }

    return critical;
  }
}
```

## Utilization Thresholds

```typescript
const UtilizationThresholds = {
  UNDER_UTILIZED: 70,   // < 70% - Look for more work
  OPTIMAL: 85,          // 70-85% - Ideal utilization
  HIGH: 95,             // 85-95% - Monitor closely
  OVER_UTILIZED: 100,   // 95-100% - At capacity
  CRITICAL: 110         // > 100% - Overbooked, need action
};

function getUtilizationStatus(percentage: number): string {
  if (percentage < 70) return 'Under-Utilized';
  if (percentage < 85) return 'Optimal';
  if (percentage < 95) return 'High Utilization';
  if (percentage <= 100) return 'At Capacity';
  return 'Over-Capacity (Critical)';
}
```

## Related PRPs
- Depends on: PRP-005 (Employee Management), PRP-007 (Project Phases), PRP-008 (Crew Assignments)
- Blocks: PRP-014 (Labor Forecast)

## Estimated Time
7-8 hours

## Notes
- Capacity calculations should run in background to avoid blocking UI
- Cache capacity results for 5 minutes to reduce database load
- Generate snapshots nightly at midnight
- Archive snapshots older than 6 months to separate table
- Utilization over 100% indicates overbooking
- Utilization under 70% indicates underutilization
- Consider factoring in PTO/vacation days (future)
- Track capacity trends to predict hiring needs
- Export capacity reports to Excel for management

## Rollback Plan
If validation fails:
1. Verify CapacitySnapshot model matches spec.md interface
2. Check capacity calculation formulas
3. Test with known employee/assignment data
4. Verify utilization percentage calculations
5. Check snapshot generation cron job
6. Test critical project detection logic
7. Revert migration: `npx prisma migrate reset`
