   - **Custom Export**: User-defined fields and filters

7. **Implement Export API Endpoints**
   - POST /api/export/excel - Generic export
   - GET /api/export/projects - Export all projects
   - GET /api/export/capacity - Export capacity data
   - GET /api/export/financial - Export financial data
   - POST /api/export/custom - Custom export with filters

8. **Add Export UI Components**
   - Export button on data tables
   - Export dialog with format options
   - Preview before export
   - Progress indicator for large exports
   - Download completed file

9. **Create Scheduled Exports**
   - Weekly automated reports via email
   - Monthly executive summary
   - End-of-month financial close export
   - Custom schedule configuration

- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage

## Validation Steps

```bash
# 1. Run unit tests
npm test -- tests/services/excel-export.test.ts
npm test -- tests/lib/excel/writer.test.ts

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Test basic export
# Navigate to Projects page
# Click "Export to Excel" button
# Verify Excel file downloads
# Open file and verify data is correct

# 4. Test multi-sheet export
# Export "Full Financial Report"
# Open Excel file
# Verify multiple sheets (Summary, SOV, Expenses, Cash Flow)
# Verify data matches application

# 5. Test formatting
# Export any report
# Verify headers are bold with background color
# Verify currency formatted as $X,XXX.XX
# Verify dates formatted as MM/DD/YYYY
# Verify columns auto-sized correctly

# 6. Test charts
# Export "Capacity Report"
# Open Excel file
# Verify chart sheet exists
# Verify charts display correctly

# 7. Test large export
# Export all projects (if >1000 records)
# Verify progress indicator shows
# Verify export completes successfully
# Verify all data included

# 8. Test custom export
# Open Export Dialog
# Select specific fields to export
# Apply filters (e.g., only active projects)
# Export and verify only selected data included

# 9. Test API endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/export/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"format": "xlsx"}' \
  --output projects.xlsx
# Should download Excel file

# 10. Test scheduled export
# Configure weekly export to email
# Manually trigger scheduled export
# Verify email received with attachment
# Verify Excel file is correct

# 11. Verify Excel file integrity
# Open exported files in Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice
# Verify compatibility across platforms

# 12. Run integration tests
npm run test:ci
```

## Export Preset Examples

### Project Summary Export
```
Sheets:
  - Summary: Count, total value, by division
  - Projects: All project details
  - Phases: All phase details
  - Charts: Budget distribution, timeline
```

### Capacity Report Export
```
Sheets:
  - Summary: Total capacity, utilization %
  - By Division: Capacity breakdown
  - By Employee: Individual allocations
  - Charts: Utilization over time, by division
```

### Financial Report Export
```
Sheets:
  - Summary: Total billed, total expenses, profit
  - SOV: Schedule of values detail
  - Expenses: All expenses by project
  - Cash Flow: 90-day projection
  - Charts: Cash flow trend, profit by project
```

## Related PRPs
- Depends on: PRP-002 (Database Foundation), PRP-016 (Schedule of Values)
- Related: PRP-019 (Excel Import), PRP-027 (Reporting Engine)
- Blocks: None (optional feature)

## Estimated Time
8-10 hours

## Notes
- Use ExcelJS library for creating Excel files
- Support only .xlsx (modern Excel) format for exports
- Limit export to 50,000 rows per sheet (Excel limitation)
- Use streaming for exports >10,000 rows to reduce memory
- Generate files server-side, not client-side (better performance)
- Cache generated exports for 1 hour (if requested again, serve from cache)
- Include export metadata footer (Generated on DATE by USER)
- Add watermark for confidential reports
- Support export to Google Sheets (future enhancement)
- Consider adding CSV export as lightweight alternative
- Log all exports to audit log
- Compress large Excel files before download (zip)
- Support exporting filtered/sorted data as displayed in UI

## Rollback Plan
If validation fails:
1. Check ExcelJS installation: `npm list exceljs`
2. Verify data formatters return correct structure
3. Test with small dataset first (10 rows)
4. Check styling utilities apply correctly
5. Verify chart generation with sample data
6. Test file download in different browsers
7. Check memory usage for large exports (use streaming if needed)
8. Verify Excel file opens in Microsoft Excel
9. Test compatibility with Google Sheets and LibreOffice
10. Review error handling for missing data
