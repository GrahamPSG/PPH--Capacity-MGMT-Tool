## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create .env.staging for staging environment
   - Create .env.production for production environment
   - Document all required environment variables
   - Use secrets management (GitHub Secrets, Vercel Env Vars)
   - Never commit sensitive values to repository

2. **Configure Vercel Project**
   - Create Vercel project via CLI or dashboard
   - Link GitHub repository
   - Configure production and preview deployments
   - Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Configure custom domain (if applicable)

    - Monitor error rate (alert if >1% of requests)
    - Track error trends
    - Set up custom error boundaries

13. **Set Up Performance Monitoring**
    - Configure Datadog APM (or Vercel Analytics)
    - Monitor API response times
    - Track database query performance
    - Monitor cache hit ratio
    - Alert on performance degradation
    - Set up custom metrics

14. **Create Deployment Notifications**
    - Slack notifications for deployments
    - Include: branch, commit, deployer, environment
    - Link to deployment URL
    - Show deployment status (pending, success, failed)
    - Tag relevant team members

### Phase 6: Vercel Deployment Protocol (CRITICAL)

15. **Implement Vercel Deployment Protocol**
    Following the protocol from CLAUDE.md:

    **Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checks**
    - [ ] Run full test suite locally: `npm run test:ci`
    - [ ] Run build locally: `npm run build`
    - [ ] Verify all environment variables set in Vercel
    - [ ] Review changes since last deployment
    - [ ] Notify team of upcoming deployment

    **Step 2: Deploy**
    - For staging: `vercel` (creates preview deployment)
    - For production: `vercel --prod`
    - Alternative: Use GitHub Actions workflow (recommended)
    - Wait for "Ready!" message in output

    **Step 3: Verify Deployment**
    - Check deployment status: `vercel ls`
    - Verify deployment URL is accessible
    - Check Vercel dashboard for build logs
    - Verify no build errors or warnings

    **Step 4: Test Functionality**
    - Visit deployed URL
    - Test critical user flows:
      - Login/authentication
      - View projects list
      - Create/edit project
      - View capacity dashboard
      - Generate report
    - Test on mobile device
    - Verify database connectivity

    **Step 5: Check Logs**
    - Run: `vercel logs [deployment-url]`
    - Monitor for runtime errors
    - Check for any warnings
    - Verify API endpoints returning correct responses
    - Monitor for at least 10 minutes

    **Step 6: Smoke Tests**
    - Run automated smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke -- --env=production`
    - Verify all tests pass
    - Check health endpoint: `curl https://[deployment-url]/api/health`
    - Verify returns 200 OK

    **Step 7: Monitor**
    - Watch error rate in Sentry (should be <1%)
    - Monitor API response times (should be <500ms P95)
    - Check database connection pool (should have available connections)
    - Monitor for at least 30 minutes post-deployment

    **NEVER report deployment as successful without:**
    - âœ… Build completed successfully (no errors)
    - âœ… Deployment is accessible via URL
    - âœ… No runtime errors in Vercel logs
    - âœ… Key functionality tested and working
    - âœ… Smoke tests passed
    - âœ… No error spike in monitoring
    - âœ… Database migrations applied successfully

    **If errors are found:**
    - ðŸš¨ Report errors immediately with details
    - ðŸš¨ Check build logs: `vercel logs --follow`
    - ðŸš¨ Check runtime logs for stack traces
    - ðŸš¨ Rollback if errors are critical
    - ðŸš¨ Fix issues before claiming deployment success

### Phase 7: Rollback Procedures

16. **Create Rollback Plan**
    - **Vercel Rollback**:
      - Via dashboard: Select previous deployment, click "Promote to Production"
      - Via CLI: `vercel rollback [deployment-url]`
      - Verify rollback successful
    - **Railway Rollback**:
      - Via dashboard: Select previous deployment, click "Redeploy"
      - Via CLI: `railway rollback`
    - **Database Rollback**:
      - Restore from backup
      - Run down migrations (if applicable)
      - Verify data integrity

17. **Document Rollback Procedures**
    - Step-by-step rollback guide
    - Contact information for escalation
    - Decision criteria for rollback
    - Post-rollback verification steps

## Related PRPs
- Depends on: ALL previous PRPs (this is the final deployment)
- Blocks: NONE (this is the last PRP)
- Critical dependency: PRP-029 (Security Hardening)

## Estimated Time
14-16 hours

## Notes

### Vercel-Specific Considerations
- Vercel has serverless function timeout limits (10s on Hobby, 60s on Pro)
- Large reports or data exports may need to be moved to background jobs
- Use Vercel Edge Middleware for performance-critical routes
- Vercel automatically handles SSL/TLS certificates
- Use Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring (or Datadog)
- Preview deployments created for every PR automatically
- Production deployments can be protected with password

### Railway-Specific Considerations
- Railway provides PostgreSQL and Redis as managed services
- Automatic backups for PostgreSQL (configurable retention)
- Redis persistence can be enabled (RDB or AOF)
- Railway provides usage-based pricing (monitor costs)
- Health checks ensure services restart on failure
- Railway CLI allows running commands against deployed services

### Database Migration Best Practices
- **Always test in staging first**
- **Always backup before production migration**
- Use Prisma Shadow Database for development
- Avoid breaking schema changes (e.g., dropping columns)
- Plan for zero-downtime migrations:
  - Add new column (nullable)
  - Deploy code to populate new column
  - Backfill old data
  - Deploy code to use new column
  - Remove old column in next deployment
- Keep migrations small and incremental
- Document any manual steps required

### Monitoring Thresholds
- **Error Rate**: Alert if >1% of requests fail
- **API Response Time**: Alert if P95 >500ms
- **Database Connections**: Alert if pool >80% utilized
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Alert if <70%
- **Disk Usage**: Alert if >80% on PostgreSQL
- **Memory Usage**: Alert if >80% on any service

### Deployment Checklist
Before every production deployment:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security scan passing (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Performance tests passing
- [ ] Database migration plan documented
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Team notified of deployment
- [ ] Off-hours deployment scheduled (if major changes)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards open
- [ ] Smoke tests ready to run
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment Protocol checklist ready**

### Post-Deployment Checklist
After every production deployment:
- [ ] Smoke tests passed
- [ ] No error spikes in Sentry
- [ ] API response times normal
- [ ] Database performance normal
- [ ] Cache working correctly
- [ ] Real-time features working (WebSocket)
- [ ] Mobile app working
- [ ] Team notified of successful deployment
- [ ] Deployment documented in changelog
- [ ] **All Vercel Deployment Protocol steps completed**

## Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback
- Critical errors affecting >10% of users
- Data corruption detected
- Security vulnerability introduced
- Performance degradation >50%
- Core functionality broken

### Vercel Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard
# 1. Go to Vercel dashboard
# 2. Click on project
# 3. Go to "Deployments" tab
# 4. Find previous working deployment
# 5. Click "..." menu
# 6. Click "Promote to Production"
# 7. Verify rollback successful

# Option 2: Via Vercel CLI
vercel rollback [previous-deployment-url]

# Option 3: Redeploy previous commit
git revert [bad-commit-hash]
git push origin main
# Triggers new deployment with previous code
```

### Railway Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Via Railway Dashboard
# 1. Go to Railway dashboard
# 2. Select service
# 3. Go to "Deployments" tab
# 4. Click on previous deployment
# 5. Click "Redeploy"

# Via Railway CLI
railway rollback
```

### Database Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Option 1: Restore from backup
railway run --environment production psql < backup.sql

# Option 2: Run down migration (if applicable)
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back [migration_name]

# Verify data integrity after rollback
railway run --environment production psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects;"
```

### Post-Rollback Steps
1. Verify application is working correctly
2. Run smoke tests against rolled-back version
3. Check error monitoring (errors should stop)
4. Notify team of rollback
5. Create incident report
6. Plan fix for issues that caused rollback
7. Test fix thoroughly in staging before re-deploying

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Fails on Vercel
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all dependencies in package.json
- Check TypeScript errors
- Verify environment variables set correctly
- Try building locally first: `npm run build`

### Database Connection Fails
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Check Railway PostgreSQL is running
- Verify connection pool settings
- Check IP whitelist (if applicable)
- Test connection with: `railway run npx prisma db push`

### Smoke Tests Fail
- Check which specific test failed
- Review logs for that endpoint
- Test endpoint manually with curl
- Verify environment variables
- Check database has necessary seed data

### High Error Rate After Deployment
- Check Sentry for error details
- Review Vercel logs for stack traces
- Rollback if errors are critical
- Fix issue and redeploy

### Performance Degradation
- Check Vercel Analytics for slow endpoints
- Review database query performance
- Check Redis cache hit ratio
- Verify no N+1 query issues
- Consider adding indexes

## Final Notes

This PRP is the culmination of all previous PRPs. It brings together the entire application and makes it production-ready.

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: The Vercel Deployment Protocol from CLAUDE.md MUST be followed for every deployment. Never report a deployment as successful without completing all verification steps.

Success criteria for this PRP:
- âœ… Application deployed to production
- âœ… All services healthy and monitored
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline automated
- âœ… Rollback procedures tested
- âœ… **Vercel Deployment Protocol followed and documented**
- âœ… Team trained on deployment process
- âœ… Documentation complete

Only when all of the above are true can this PRP be marked as complete.
